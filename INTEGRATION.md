## VFD Configuration

**Note:** These notes are only really useful for the Hitachi L-100. If you're using another VFD consult your documentation.

`P24` provides a 24V field reference voltage for use when powering the Control Terminals.

When configured correctly we desire the following outcome:

- To tell the turntable to run forward short `P24` to `PIN 1`.
- To tell the turntable to run in revers short `P24` to `PIN 2`.

### VFD Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `a01` | `00` | `00`=Keypad/Potentiometer, `01`=Control Terminals, `02`=F01 Settings |
| `a02` | `02` | `01`=Control Terminals, `02`=Keypad Run Key |
| `a02` | `02` | `01`=Control Terminals, `02`=Keypad Run Key |
| `a61` | `60` | Set a hard limit on the output frequency of the VFD to never overdrive the motor. |
| `a04` | `60` | Set the "Base" Frequency. (The frequency at which the VFD emits full voltage) |
| `a05` | `60` | Set the "Max" Frequency (The frequency allowed during manual opeation) |
| `a97` | `00` | Set the Acceleration Curve: `00`=Linear, `01`=S-Curve |
| `a97` | `00` | Set the Deceleration Curve: `00`=Linear, `01`=S-Curve |
| `c01` | `00` | Configure Terminal 1: `00`=Run Forward
| `c02` | `01` | Configure Terminal 2: `01`=Run Reverse
| `f01` | `nn` | **Set the target frequency** |
| `f02` | `nn` | **Set the acceleration time** (The number of seconds it should take to get spin-up from 0Hz to `f01`Hz) |
| `f03` | `nn` | **Set the deceleration time** (The number of seconds it should take to get spin-down from `f01`Hz to 0Hz) |
