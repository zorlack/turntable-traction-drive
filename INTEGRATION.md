# Turntable Traction Drive Integration Guide

This guide is designed to help scenic designers and technical directors integrate the Turntable Traction Drive into their sets.

## Safety

As it's intended use involves live actors on a rotating stage, safety must be considered seriously. 

:warning: **The Turntable Traction Drive is a powerful machine. Using it should not be taken lightly. Caution and care must be taken in every integration to ensure that safe operating parameters are configured.**

A turntable may pose a hazard on set even when operated manually by backstage technicians, however, unlike backstage technicians this machine has no brain. It doesn't know to stop because a piece of scenery is late during a scene-shift. It is not context-aware. Also, unlike a backstage technician, under the right circumstances this machine can summon inhuman amounts of torque.

:warning: **Due to its power and remoteness this machine is not designed as part of an automation system. Rather, it is intended to be manually operated by a user with a clear view of the turntable.**

As some risk is unavoidable, my analysis will focus on mitigation strategies.

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
| -- | -- |
| Electrical shock hazard | **Requirements:** Ground VFD appropriately to input mains. Ground motor appropriately to VFD. Ground chassis appropriately to the motor chassis. |
| Pinching hazards from rotating internal equipment and rotating top sprocket |  **Requirements:** Turntable Traction Drive must be in a fully enclosed secure area during operation. |
| Pinching/Crushing hazards between traction wheels and turntable edge | **Requirements:** Interface between the turntable and the traction drive must be fully enclosed during operation. |
| Risk of unexpected start | **Requirements:** Enable Unattended Start Protection in VFD by setting `c04` to `13` and short `P24` to `PIN 4` |
| Risk of fall due to sudden acceleration | Use conservative values for `f01`, `f02`, and `f03`. |
| Risk of fall due to overspeed | Set a conservative hard frequency limit using `a61` |
| Risk of crushing | #UNKNOWN# Investigate `B_12` and current overload protection. |
| Risk of crushing because of external scenery-based crush points. | **Requirements:** Turntables must maintain a raidal safety margin sufficient to prevent a person from being caught between a rotating piece of scenery and an adjacent non-rotating piece of scenery. Emergency Stop button must located near the turntable. Cast and crew must be trained on the location of the e-stop button. |
| Risk of entanglement | **Requirements:** Operator must have a clear view of the turntable. Emergency Stop button must located near the turntable. Cast and crew must be trained on the location of the e-stop button. |
| Risk of slipping on a free-rotating turntable | **Requirement** A parking brake must be employed when the Turntable Traction Drive is not in use. All on-stage personel must be instructed on the free-rotating-nature of the turntable. |
| Risk of operator/integrator ignorance | **Requirements:** All safety requirements and warnings must be clearly printed on a label applied to the machine. Documentation must be made available. |

## VFD Configuration

**Note:** These notes are only really useful for the Hitachi L-100. If you're using another VFD consult your documentation.

`P24` provides a 24V field reference voltage for use when powering the Control Terminals.

When configured correctly we desire the following outcome:

- To tell the turntable to run forward short `P24` to `PIN 1`.
- To tell the turntable to run in revers short `P24` to `PIN 2`.

### VFD Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `a01` | `00` | `00`=Keypad/Potentiometer, `01`=Control Terminals, `02`=F01 Settings |
| `a02` | `02` | `01`=Control Terminals, `02`=Keypad Run Key |
| `a02` | `02` | `01`=Control Terminals, `02`=Keypad Run Key |
| `a61` | `60` | Set a hard limit on the output frequency of the VFD to never overdrive the motor. |
| `a04` | `60` | Set the "Base" Frequency. (The frequency at which the VFD emits full voltage) |
| `a05` | `60` | Set the "Max" Frequency (The frequency allowed during manual opeation) |
| `a97` | `00` | Set the Acceleration Curve: `00`=Linear, `01`=S-Curve |
| `a97` | `00` | Set the Deceleration Curve: `00`=Linear, `01`=S-Curve |
| `c01` | `00` | Configure Terminal 1: `00`=Run Forward
| `c02` | `01` | Configure Terminal 2: `01`=Run Reverse
| `f01` | `nn` | **Set the target frequency** |
| `f02` | `nn` | **Set the acceleration time** (The number of seconds it should take to get spin-up from 0Hz to `f01`Hz) |
| `f03` | `nn` | **Set the deceleration time** (The number of seconds it should take to get spin-down from `f01`Hz to 0Hz) |
