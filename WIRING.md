# Wiring Guide

For the sake of reusability we have wired our VFD into a semi-permanent control panel using DIN terminal blocks to connect the user wiring. **This control panel is designed to be fully enclosed during use.**

Be sure to follow the VFD manufacturer's specifications when selecing wiring materials. You don't want to under-spec the mains or motor wiring.
