# Turntable Traction Drive Documentation

<image alt="Design Render" src="images/design-render.jpg" width=600 />

This is my design for a Turntable Traction Drive. It's meant to turn a large theatrical turntable covered in sets and actors in a safe reliable way. It can be built for less than $3000 USD.

I was inspired to take on this project by Alan Hendrickson's chain-driven design featured in [Technical Designs Solutions for Theatre Volume 2 (Sammler/Harvey 2002)](https://www.amazon.com/Technical-Design-Solutions-Theatre-Collection/dp/0240804929). His design shows how a chain drive can rotate a turntable. I was interested in designing an easier-to-integrate "bolt-on" solution.
