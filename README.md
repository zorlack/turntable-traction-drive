# Turntable Traction Drive Project

<image alt="Design Render" src="images/design-render.jpg" width=600 />

This is my design for a Turntable Traction Drive. It's meant to turn a large theatrical turntable covered in sets and actors in a safe reliable way. It can be built for less than $3000 USD.

I was inspired to take on this project by Alan Hendrickson's chain-driven design featured in [Technical Designs Solutions for Theatre Volume 2 (Sammler/Harvey 2002)](https://www.amazon.com/Technical-Design-Solutions-Theatre-Collection/dp/0240804929). His design shows how a chain drive can rotate a turntable. I was interested in designing an easier-to-integrate "bolt-on" solution.

### Powerplant Details

My motor decision was based on what I had lying around. You may easily sub in your own motor, but for simplicity of integration try to pick a motor matching NEMA Frame 145TC. Otherwise you may have to drill new holes in the `Base Plate` and `Motor Gusset`.

| Powerplant Feature |  Detail |
| -------------- | ------------------------------|
| Model | General Electric 2HP TEFC (5KE48WN8167) |
| Speed | 1725 RPM at 60Hz |
| Layout | NEMA Frame 145TC |
| Gearhead | Morse 175Q140LR5 |
| Gearhead Ratio | 5:1 |

### Control Details

In order to vary the speed of drive motor we must use a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD). The VFD will be responsible for managing the speed and acceleration of the traction drive. Choosing the right motor controller is therefore key to the reliability and safety of the system. 

| VFD Feature |  Detail |
| -------------- | ------------------------------|
| Model | Hitachi L-100 (L100-007NFU)  |
| Input Power | 120VAC 15A |
| Output Power | 0.75 KW (1 HP) |
| Output Range | 0 - 360Hz |
