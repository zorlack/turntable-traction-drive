# Turntable Traction Drive Project

<image alt="Design Render" src="images/design-render.jpg" width=600 />

This is my design for a Turntable Traction Drive. It's meant to turn a large theatrical turntable covered in sets and actors in a safe reliable way. It can be built for less than $3000 USD.

I was inspired to take on this project by Alan Hendrickson's chain-driven design featured in [Technical Designs Solutions for Theatre Volume 2 (Sammler/Harvey 2002)](https://www.amazon.com/Technical-Design-Solutions-Theatre-Collection/dp/0240804929). His design shows how a chain drive can rotate a turntable. I was interested in designing an easier-to-integrate "bolt-on" solution.

Feel free to make your own or iterate on this in any way permitted by the [license](LICENSE)! If you do happen to build one, send me a picture, I'd love to share it!

### Powerplant Details

My motor decision was based on what I had lying around. You may easily sub in your own motor, but for simplicity of integration try to pick a motor matching NEMA Frame 145TC. Otherwise you may have to drill new holes in the `Base Plate` and `Motor Gusset`.

| Powerplant Feature |  Detail |
| -------------- | ------------------------------|
| Model | General Electric 2HP TEFC (5KE48WN8167) |
| Speed | 1725 RPM at 60Hz |
| Layout | NEMA Frame 145TC |
| Gearhead | Morse 175Q140LR5 |
| Gearhead Ratio | 5:1 |

### Control Details

In order to vary the speed of drive motor we must use a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD). The VFD will be responsible for managing the speed and acceleration of the traction drive. 

#### VFD for 3 Phase Power
In our environment we have easy and plentiful access to 3phase 208v. For this reason we have selected a 3phase input VFD. If you have access to 3 phase power you can benfit from our integration notes throughout this documentation.

| VFD Feature |  Detail |
| -------------- | ------------------------------|
| Model | Automation Direct DURA Pulse (GS23-22P0)  |
| Input Power | 230V 3-Phase (208 is fine) |
| Output Power | 1.5 KW (2 HP) |
| Output Range | 0 - 600Hz |
| Safe Torque Off (STO) | Yes |

#### Initial Testing VFD 
Our initial testing was performed on a .75 HP 120V VFD. We were able to easily turn the 23' turntable using just a single wall outlet. This may be enough for many applications but be aware that VFDs under load have a nasty habbit of tripping residential breakers (especially RCD/GFCI circuits.)

| VFD Feature |  Detail |
| -------------- | ------------------------------|
| Model | Hitachi L-100 (L100-007NFU)  |
| Input Power | 120VAC 15A |
| Output Power | 0.75 KW (1 HP) |
| Output Range | 0 - 360Hz |
| Safe Torque Off (STO) | **No** |

We decided to replace this VFD for two reasons:

- In our environment 3-phase 208 is easily availble, and since 1HP isn't really up to the demands of our motor, the testing VFD didn't make a lot of sense.
- The intial wiring design of our e-stop buttons was not up to industrial automation standards. Critically, the e-stop was unable to constrain a runaway VFD. As a hedge agasint this risk we have selected a VFD with a Safe Torque Off (STO) feature. This feature adds independant hardware designed to reliably disconnect the output transistors of the VFD from the motor.
